1. I'm using coinmarketcap.com
2. Edit the config.txt file to suit your environment
3. You'll need to get an API key from https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/ and add it to the config.txt file
4. Edit the files htmltoptemplate.txt and htmlbottomtemplate.txt to format the widget the way you want it.
5. Keep all of the files in the root, or make sure you add the path to the config.txt. Otherwise, shit will break.
6. Be careful with API calls on a free API KEY. You're limited to 300 / day.
